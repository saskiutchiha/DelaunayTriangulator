## Project Overview
Triangulation is a fundamental technique used in various fields such as computer graphics, finite element analysis, and geographic information systems. This project implements a triangulation algorithm and provides a GUI to visualize and interact with the triangulation process.

### Features
- **Triangulation Algorithm:** Implements a robust triangulation algorithm that divides a set of points into non-overlapping triangles.
- **GUI Visualization:** The PyQt5-based GUI allows users to view the triangulated mesh and interact with the application.
- **Matplotlib Integration:** Uses matplotlib to plot and visualize the triangulated mesh.
